Anigbata notched her first victory in the long jump event with a leap of 5.89m/19-4.00 to highlight K-Stateâ€™s success in the field.

Since winning the African Games crown, Anigbata joined the Kansas State Wildcats last year, and jumped 13.07m to win her first competition with the university. Before that, Anigbata spent two years at Cloud County Community College, a junior college in Kansas. She is yet to better her personal best of 14.02m, set at the 2018 African Champi- onships, where she also won the gold medal, but is hopeful of reaching the Olympic qualification standard in the coming months.
