–Charles Inojie
He was one of Nollywood’s star actors and most sought after playboy role interpreters of the late ‹90s and early 2000s. He was about to carve a niche for himself in rap music when he died. I am broken hearted! He was a happy man
–Caz Chidiebere
Ernest Asuzu was full of energy and fun to be with. He had a lot upstairs. We saw and chatted about his come back bid recently. May he find peace in Heaven. We lost a big asset
–Prince Iyke Olisa
Death has taken another asset from Nollywood but we find solace in the fact that he was able to rekindle a strong relationship with his maker. Rest on brother. He was my mentor
–Nani Boi
I looked up to him as an up-and-coming movie maker especially his movies directed by Teco Benson. We have lost an icon! Rest on in the bosom of The Lord. He was an amazing actor
–Ijeoma Thomas
