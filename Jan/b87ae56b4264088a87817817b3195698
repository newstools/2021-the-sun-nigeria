By Joe Apu The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic around the world is leaving many in doubts over the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games following the declaration of a state of emergency. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba in order to contain the increased spread of the coronavirus. According to a report by otbsports.com, the restrictions will come into effect today and remain in place until at least February 7th. Those restrictions will only be lifted next month if there is a significant reduction in certain benchmarks such as hospital occupancy rates and positivity rates.
Japan has reported a total  of 258,393 cases but deaths from the virus have doubled  in less than two months, pass- ing 3,700, while Tokyo re- ported 2,447 cases on Thursday, a daily record.
