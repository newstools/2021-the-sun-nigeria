Chukwu disclosed this on Sunday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at his Trans Ekulu residence, Enugu.

However, the former Green Eagles captain, who celebrated his 70th birthday on Jan. 4, 2021, said that he was surprised that some people would wish him death. “I am terribly embarrassed with this news that I am dead. Several people have been calling me from across the world since the news broke. “I am still investigating the source of the story,” he said. Chukwu, popularly known as ‘chairman’ during his career days, said that God was in control of his life. He advised journalists and social media influencers to always investigate and get their facts right before writing. NAN reports that Chukwu was in company of some of his close associates, including Barry Diala, Joseph Agu and his kinsman, Peter Agu when he granted the interview. (NAN)
