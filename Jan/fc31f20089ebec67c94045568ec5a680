Ifeanyi Aniagboso, The book is a collection of realities expected to aknowledge and change the various pieces of our lives and endowments as Christians. I firmly recommend it for all individual who appreciates a progressively critical level of our blessings as Christians.” Ven. John Adubasim said, “The Church is at the crossroad with incessant distraction, thereby distorting our God-given mission. The author carefully pointed out the very essence of the Church and the need for the exploration of various gifts within the Body of Christ for the edification of the Church. It is well endorsed for all.” Dame (Dr.) Mercy Oke-Chinda declared, “One of the issues that plague the church today is discord. Proliferation has become worrisome, a mockery to the body of Christ. Spreading the good news of the kingdom is a primary assignment for all believers and the author specified these concerns in the book.”
