The Rivers State government-owned Real Madrid Football Academy, Port Harcourt will today begin a four-day process towards admitting the first set of students for the academy. Intending students are expected to undergo aptitude tests before being subjected to physical football screening exercise at the Sharks Football Club Stadium. So far, over 1,500 applications have been received from an initial 2,300 that applied from every state of the federation in what promises to be a highly competitive admission process.
