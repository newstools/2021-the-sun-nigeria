By Steve Agbota The Apapa Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday, said it impounded 133 containers of unregistered pharmaceutical product, including tramadol in 2020. Speaking at a media briefing, the Customs Area Controller of the command, Comptroller Mohammed Abba-Kura, said most of the pharmaceutical products don’t have manufacture and expiry date, adding that the seized drugs also lack addresses of where they were produced.

Accordingly, he said the command made a total 318 seizures with Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N21.197 billion.
