Nigeria’s Henry Onyekuru admits signing for Everton was something of a risk but insists he has no regrets about the move as he looks for a move away from his current club AS Monaco in France. The 23-year-old joined the English Premier League side in 2017 but failed to make a competitive appearance for the club. He arrived at Everton from Belgian club KAS Eupen on the back of a 22-goal season, but was immediately sent on loan to Anderlecht. That was followed by another loan this time to Turkish side Galatasaray before sealing a permanent move to French club AS Monaco in 2019. “The first dream is to play in the Premier League, it may not have worked out at Everton but I have no regrets about it,” Onyekuru told BBC Africa Sport. “When I received offers from top clubs in England I knew back then that I needed a work permit to play. “That it didn’t happen then has nothing to do with my talent but red tape that’s beyond my control.”
