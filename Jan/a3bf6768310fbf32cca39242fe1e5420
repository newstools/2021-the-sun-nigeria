The Nigerian striker, who is due to return to Shanghai Shenhua at the end of the month, has expressed his desire to play in the United States. Odion Ighalo has opened the door to a potential switch to MLS as he approaches the end of his loan spell at Manchester United. The Red Devils surprised many when they snapped up Ighalo from Shanghai Shenhua on a six-month deal in last year’s winter transfer window. The 31-year-old scored five goals for United in the second half of the 2020-19 campaign, despite mainly being used as a substitute, providing valuable cover for Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford in the final third of the pitch. United decided to extend Ighalo’s loan through to 2021 at the start of June, but he has been starved of regular minutes in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad since the start of their latest campaign. Edinson Cavani’s arrival at Old Trafford on a free transfer saw the Nigerian frontman fall completely out of favour, with the 31-year-old only managing four appearances in all competitions, so far, this season. Ighalo will return to his parent club at the end of the month, but he is not planning to stay in China for the long-term, having already pinpointed the United States as a possible next destination. “I have been watching MLS and the league is doing well and I would like to play in the MLS,” the Shanghai Shenhua loanee told ESPN. “I have to wait for offers and if the opportunity arises, I will take it because the league is doing well and it is a good life and I would love it.
