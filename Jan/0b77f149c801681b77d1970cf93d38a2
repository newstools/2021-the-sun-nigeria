The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) says it welcomes the municipal elections in four different municipalities in western Libya. The mission disclosed this on Thursday in a statement by Stephanie Williams, acting special representative of the UN secretary-general in Libya. “UNSMIL welcomes the first four municipal council elections in 2021 that are taking place today in the municipalities of Hay Alandalus and Swani Bin Adam of Greater Tripoli, and Gasr Alakhiar and Zlitin, in the West,” the mission said. The mission acknowledged the “determination of the Libyan people to exercise democratic right and the efforts of the Central Committee for Municipal Council Elections (CCMCE) in conducting electoral processes in full compliance with precautionary measures for the Coronavirus, in line with the recommendations of National Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation.” “I encourage all registered voters, in particular women, youth and vulnerable groups to participate in the polls, while taking all precautionary measures, to contribute to peaceful and inclusive electoral processes,” Williams said. According to the CCMCE, the voting in the four municipalities was concluded on Thursday, with a voter turnout of 35 percent. (dpa/NAN)
