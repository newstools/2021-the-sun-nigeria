Emirates airline, along with dnata, are among the first transport and air services organisations in the world to offer employees the option to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus for its UAE based workforce in coordination with the Dubai Health Authority and the Ministry of Health and Prevention. The inoculation drive began on Monday January 18th with priority being placed on its frontline aviation workforce, including Cabin Crew, Flight Deck and other operationally focused roles. The Emirates Group is making both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinopharm vaccines, which have been approved by the UAE health authorities, conveniently accessible to its employees at various company locations across the UAE. Inoculation appointments will run 12 hours a day, seven days a week to ensure as many essential aviation workers as possible can get the vaccine. Emirates Group employees in the UAE can also opt to get vaccinated at government designated medical centres and clinics, as the UAEâ€™s leadership and health authorities have spared no effort to make vaccines free and accessible to the population. Over the course of the pandemic, Emirates and dnata have implemented multiple layers of safety measures to ensure the health and safety of customers, employees and the communities served. The rollout of its vaccination programme is another step forward, helping to safeguard the health and wellbeing of aviation employees who serve the travelling public and help move essential goods around the world.
