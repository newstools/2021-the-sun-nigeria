According to the traders, the price of tomatoes usually dropped during its harvest season. One of them, Miss Oge Madu, a tomato seller, at Garki Market, said that the major reason for the sudden reduction in price of tomatoes was due to the cultivation of tomatoes in Enugu (Nsukka) “The Nsukka tomatoes are also flooding the markets and this has made the commodity to reduce in price. “During rainy season tomatoes are scarce, the prices are high, but in dry season, they are surplus and the prices usually drop,” Madu said.
