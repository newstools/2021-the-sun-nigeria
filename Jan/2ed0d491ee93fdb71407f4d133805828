From Okwe Obi, Abuja A socio-political organization, Tinubu Support Group (TSG), has warned mischief makers against linking the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to the crisis between the Yoruba and Fulani community in Oyo State. The group further debunked a report credited to the National Coordinator of Northern Patriots Assembly, Salihu Mohammed for accusing Tinubu of sponsoring the crisis, noting that the report lacked substance as it was a bunch of lies from the pit of hell, originated by a sick mind. TSG Head of Media and Publicity, Oluwatosin Johnson, in a statement on Monday, contended that it was impossible for a man who has always shown his commitment as detribalised leader to sponsor such inter-ethnic crisis. “There is a need to set the facts and record straight to avoid such a fake story may being taken seriously by some unwary and gullible minds. “Asiwaju Tinubu believes in the right of Nigerians to reside wherever they so wish, and has always canvassed the need for people to explore peaceful channels to ventilate their views and demands. “Lagos state is one of the few states in Nigeria where citizens of Nigeria from other geo-political zones are given opportunity to occupy political offices within the state. “This is happening because Asiwaju is a detribalised leader who has always preached the need for one Nigeria. “We urge Nigerians to ignore their claim. It is obvious that they are politically sponsored to lower the esteem of the Leader of our great party. “Let us continue to support the administration of our dear President as he continues to lead the fight against insecurity in the country,” he said.
