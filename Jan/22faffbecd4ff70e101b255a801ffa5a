According to community sources, the gunmen stormed the community in three speed boats and began to shoot sporadically ostensibly to scare the people before they proceeded to set some buildings in the community ablaze. Pastor Lorhi-bolouikie Ogoro, a native of the Ogila-ama, community but resident in Yenagoa said people of the community living in Yenagoa have been inundated with calls over the attack and the palpable fear in the area. Mr Ogoro appealed to the state government to come to the communityâ€™s rescue and arrest the situation.
