The leadership of the Delta State chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) has assured that the Delta State Local Governments Sports Festival has come to stay and will get bigger and better in coming years. The outgoing Chairman of Delta State ALGON, Hon Itiako Constantine Ikpokpo, gave the assurance in a press briefing in Asaba during the week. Ikpokpo who held a valedictory executive meeting on Wednesday to mark the end of his two-term service as the chairman of Isoko South LGA said despite the change in the leadership of ALGON, the initiative of the Delta States Local Government Sports Festival will be sustained as a legacy commitment of the state’s council chairmen to institutionalize a programme of steadily sup- porting the state in the discovery of athletes and using sports to drive grassroots development. “We have structured the project in such a way that it is private sector driven. We have the project consultant to work with the leadership of ALGON to ensure continuity. The project is run by private sector sponsorship. UBA and Levant Construction are graciously partnering with us on this first edition and we believe that subsequent editions will attract larger sponsorships. The good thing is that it is a biennial event, so we will have time to plan every succeeding edition with lessons from the preceding edition.
