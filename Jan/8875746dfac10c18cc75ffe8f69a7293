West Brom have requested a visa for free agent Ahmed Musa with the Nigerian booked for an Albion medical on Wednesday, according to the Daily Mail. Outlet SportsRation linked the forward with a move to The Hawthorns on Saturday as they claimed that the Baggies were one of two Premier League clubs interested in Musa. This report seems to be correct with the Daily Mail now claiming that the club has decided to request a visa and book a medical ahead of the Nigerian’s arrival in the UK. The Daily Mail claimed that, should the medical go well, Musa would sign a deal that would see him become an Albion player for the rest of the season. It seems as though this deal may be progressing rapidly as the report claims that medical tests have been booked for Wednesday and a UK visa request is already in the hands of the relevant authorities. He will provide the attacking boost that Sam Allardyce is looking for as Albion continues to fight against an immediate return to the Championship. The Baggies have their first win under Allardyce and there was a definite improvement in performance against West Ham despite the 2-1 loss. A new forward is desperately needed as Karlan Grant has struggled to make an impact since he joined from Huddersfield in the summer. Musa looks like he could be the man that Big Sam has chosen to help fire Albion to safety as the Baggies boss continues to add to his squad this month. This transfer is ideal for Big Sam as he is securing the services of a player with Premier League experience without shelling out on a transfer fee as Albion’s finances continue to struggle. Hopefully we will see Musa in an Albion shirt before the window closes as Allardyce is close to securing the signing of the new striker he desperately needs.
