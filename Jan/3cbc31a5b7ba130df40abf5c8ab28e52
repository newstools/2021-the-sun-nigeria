From Desmond Mgboh, Kano Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would emerge victorious at the local government polls in the state. The governor spoke to reporters shortly after casting his votes at Ward 008 in his home town, Ganduje, on Saturday. According to him, ‘the election is highly impressive. You can see how people turned out to vote and it is peaceful. This shows that the election was accepted by all the people in Kano State. ‘This gives us confidence especially as we don’t believe in a caretaker committee to be managing the local governments. Therefore, we must have elected officials to manage the affairs of our 44 local government Areas. ‘That is why we decided to conduct this election at the local government level to serve, after the end of tenure for those elected three years ago. ‘From what obtains, you can see that the people are orderly, the people are willing, the people are voting. There is no intimidation, there is no harassment of anybody and they are voting the people that they like. ‘Our expectation is that we will win all the 44 Local Government Areas and the 484 councillors through the ballot box and not through intimidation.’ He called on the people of the to vote wisely while assuring that those voted for will serve them accordingly. ‘The message to the people is that they vote the people that they have confidence in and we assure them that those they vote for will work for them. It is a kind of franchise they are not being marginalised and they will get their dividend of democracy.’  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
