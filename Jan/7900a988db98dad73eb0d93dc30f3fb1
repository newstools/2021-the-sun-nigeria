LeBron James is changing teams in the cola wars. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar, a pitchman for Coca-Cola since entering the NBA in 2003, is set to land a new deal with PepsiCo. The news was first reported Friday by Front Office Sports, then confirmed by ESPN. James reportedly will endorse Mountain Dew’s new “Rise Energy” beverage, part of the PepsiCo family, and he also could become the face of Pepsi Cola. His deal with Coca-Cola ended last year after he spent years hawking Sprite and Powerade. A Coca-Cola spokesperson told Front Office Sports, “LeBron’s contract came up at a time when both he and The Coca-Cola Company were actively reviewing all of its resources to make sure it was investing in places that ensured long-term growth. After many discussions with LeBron and his team, we mutually agreed to part ways.”  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
