The Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu  Buhari for appointing an Abia indigene, Dr. Mrs. Uzoma Emenike as Nigeria’s Ambassador to United States, urging Ndigbo to take pride for such magnanimity. Dr. Mrs. Emenike before her cross-posting was Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland. Kalu, representing Abia North district in a chat with ABN TV on Thursday while recollecting that he along with other senators from Abia state had kicked against the nomination of single individual from Abia during the screening of the ambassadorial nominees last year said the President assured he will cross-post Dr. Mrs. Emenike to the number one embassy in the world, the US. He also thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping his promise. “I told them you can’t bring one name here and the President assured us that he will cross-post her from Ireland to Washington DC and that was why I kept quiet. It didn’t just happen by chance. “Today, it’s a reality and we thank him for that and all other interventions in the Eastern Nigeria” he said. The former Abia governor while calling on those who are of the opinion that President Muhammadu Buhari has not done much in carrying Ndigbo along in his administration to have a rethink. He added that his infrastructural interventions in the South East region points otherwise.
