Many weeks after the release of the 28-year-old’s hit single, Sade, the act is poised to ride into 2021 on a high note. According to a statement from his management, D’Luxe Management run by Franklin Amudo, ever since the release of his latest single entitled Finally, which was released in early November featuring popular DJ Neptune and produced by P Loops, the new track has been topping charts.
