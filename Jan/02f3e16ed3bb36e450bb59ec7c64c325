(NAN) US President Donald Trump on Thursday morning committed to an “orderly transition” of power on Jan 20. Trump made the promise in a statement after Congress certified Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the country’s next President and Vice President. “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on Jan 20. “I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. “While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it’s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!” he said. The statement was released through his spokesperson’s Twitter account after the company blocked the President from using his own account. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Facebook also suspended Trump’s account after using it to rally his supporters who invaded the Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Congress approved the electoral votes after both chambers rejected objections by some Republican lawmakers to the votes in Pennsylvania and Arizona. Debates of the objections to Arizona had barely started on Wednesday when Trump supporters stormed the building and disrupted the proceedings. The session resumed and continued through the night after normalcy returned.
