The documents argued upon were the statement made by one of the prosecution witness, Mr Ayoshina Adekunle; the receipt of a plot of land allegedly sold by the defendants, and the statement of the second prosecution witness in the matter. The two Gbadamoshis were dragged before the court by the men of Nigeria Police for allegedly conniving to steal, forged and uttered the title documents of a property belonging to their late Sister, Mrs Sidikatu Odunsanya valued at N40 million. They were alleged to have used the forged documents to sell the deceasedâ€™s property to one Akindele Ojo for N24.5 million without the consent of the deceased children. The defendants were first arraigned before the court sometimes in 2017 on a four-count charge of felony to wit, stealing, forgery and uttering documents. The offences, according to the prosecutor, Mr Uhumwangho, are contrary to sections 465 and 468 and punishable under sections 516, 390 (8)(b), 467 (2)(e)(h)(m)(4)(p)(q) and 467 of the Criminal Code Cap, C38, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 (as amended).
