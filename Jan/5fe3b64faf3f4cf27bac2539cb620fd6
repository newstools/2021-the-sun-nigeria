Leonard expressed the appreciation of the United States Government to Nigerians in a statement made available to Saturday Sun in Abuja by the United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria. “Our heartfelt gratitude to the many citizens of Nigeria who sent messages of support during Wednesday’s difficult hours,” Leonard  said. The United States envoy further said: “The enduring friendship and partnership between the United States and the people of Nigeria will endure and thrive as we work to perfect our union and our democracy.” Leonard also said the United States Congress has completed its constitutionally mandated count of the Electoral College vote and affirmed the election of Joseph R.
