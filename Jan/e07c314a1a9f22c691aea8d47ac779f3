From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe and the Pro-chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Board of the University of Calabar (UNICAL), Senator Nkechi Nwogu, have expressed sadness over the death of a foremost traditional ruler in Abia State, Bernard Enweremadu, the Ezeukwu I of Ngwaukwu. Abaribe said in a statement that the death of the monarch has thrown the entire Ukwa-Ngwa nation into deep mourning, adding that his death has left a huge vacuum that would be very difficult to fill. ‘As a custodian of our rich traditional heritage, Ezeukwu as we call him belongs to the class of highly respected post-colonial natural rulers, having ascended the throne at a relatively young age. He indeed belongs to the fast receding custodians of our people’s rich tradition and culture who were imbued with wisdom and carriage that goes with royalty,’ Sen Abaribe said in the statement. ‘Eze Enweremadu exuded panache and candour on the throne, while also being very close to the people. He was also successful in business and carried out philanthropic activities that benefited the people. He will be sorely missed.’ Senator Nwogu also expressed shock over the passing of the revered monarch, saying that Enweremadu died at a turbulent time when Abia State, Igbo land and Nigeria needed his elderly advice. ‘The contributions of our highly respected monarch were very conspicuous and will greatly be missed by the good people of Abia State, Nigeria as a country and the World globally. ‘The death of the septuagenarian and traditional institution of culture and tradition is twilight at dawn and one death too many. He is not dead, he has wandered into an unknown land,’ Senator Nwogu said.  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
