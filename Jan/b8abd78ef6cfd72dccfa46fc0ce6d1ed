Meanwhile, the agency called on those who may have been exposed to the virus to quarantine and isolate themselves if they feel ill. “Remember COVID-19 can spread from people that look and feel well. Don’t let your guard down around friends or relatives just because they look healthy – they may not know they are infected but can unintentionally spread COVID-19,” it advised. NAN reports the centre has so far tested 958,911 persons since the first confirmed case relating to the COVID-19 pandemic was announced in Feb. 27 2020. NAN also reports that the Federal Government on Dec. 22, 2020 imposed new restrictions amid the rising cases of COVID-19 in various parts of the country. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, explained that the directives were advisories issued to state authorities for implementation in the next five weeks. The new restrictions include civil servants from Grade Level 12 and below to stay at home for the next five weeks; the closure of all bars, nightclubs, pubs and event centres, as well as recreational venues in all states and the FCT. All restaurants were also directed to close, except those providing services to hotel residents, takeaways, home deliveries and drive-ins. (NAN)
