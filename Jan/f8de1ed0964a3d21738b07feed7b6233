The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Federal Ministry of Health are mapping out strategic guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures to safeguard Nigerian pilgrims during the 2021 hajj operation. Head, Public Affairs of NAHCON, Mrs Fatima Usara, who announced this in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, enjoined all intending pilgrims and officials of State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards to continue to observe COVID-19 protocols. This, she said, is in order to curtail the spread of the pandemic, which has entered the second wave. She said that NAHCON was awaiting further directives from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in reverence to its divine role as the custodians of the two holy mosques and its domain. The officer said the commission would continue to commend and trust the Kingdom for its courage in taking difficult decisions in the interest of Muslims all over the world, even where the unfavourable effect of such decisions was borne by the Kingdom itself. She assured Nigerian Muslims that as soon as the Saudi Arabia authority communicated new guidelines on the 2021 Hajj and Umrah, it would take appropriate actions in the interest of intending pilgrims. “NAHCON joins millions of Muslims from all over the world in sharing the optimism that lies beneath the news of Saudi Arabia, lifting its suspension on international travels. As a people of faith, saddled with the responsibility of managing Hajj and Umrah travels from Nigeria, the news holds glad tidings for those hoping to embark on hajj and umrah from Nigeria.”
