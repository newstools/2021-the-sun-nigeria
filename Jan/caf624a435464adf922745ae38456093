The average adult head weighs about 3kg, and this weight is supported by the muscles in the neck and upper back. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury can cause neck pain or stiffness. It is not surprising, then that neck pain is one of the most common complaints. Sometimes, neck pain is caused by injury from a fall, accidents, infections, abscesses. Also, many habits and activities that are a part of daily put stress and strain on neck muscles, tendons and ligaments. Sitting too long in a car or at a desk, working on a computer; having poor posture or a bad sleeping position (combined with age-related wear and tear); toting unbalanced heavy weights, jerking your neck during exercise; reacting to stress, tension and overuse, all place a great demand on the neck structures. And as a result, some muscles can degenerate/waste away, tendons can shorten and ligaments can lose their tensile strength. The neck muscles may then go into spams, causing not only neck problems, but also headaches and radiating pain in the arms and shoulders and needless to add, decreased ability to move the head. Most of the time, neck pain can be relieved within a few days. But in some cases, neck pain can indicate serious injury or illness and require a physician’s care.
