Stephen Curry scored a career-high 62 points as his Golden State Warriors beat the Portland Trailblazers 137-122. The 32-year-old is the second oldest player to score over 60 points in a game – Kobe Bryant is the oldest at 37. Curry’s previous best performance was 54 points against the New York Knicks in February 2013. “I wanted to take him out with 30 seconds left so the 42 people here could give him a standing ovation,” said Warriors head coach Steve Kerr. NBA games are being played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’ve seen Steph do so many things here over the years and it’s just a privilege to coach him,” Kerr said. “We are incredibly blessed as an organisation to have Steph leading the way. What a performance.” Curry was congratulated by many on social media, including his team-mate Klay Thompson and LA Lakers legend Magic Johnson.
