(Reuters/NAN) AC Milan goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu celebrated a rare appearance with a penalty kick save to help his side to a 5-4 shootout victory on Tuesday. The feat came following a 0-0 draw with Torino in the Italian Cup. Romanian Tatarusanu saved from Torinoâ€™s Tomas Rincon to secure victory for his side and a meeting with either local rivals Inter Milan or Fiorentina in the quarter-finals. Those two sides are in action on Wednesday. AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was given his first start since a thigh injury ruled him out for six weeks in November, but he was replaced at half-time in what was a low-key return. After a tame first half in which neither side created much in the way of goalscoring chances, AC Milan came out with more purpose in the second half. They might have been 2-0 up inside the opening 15 minutes after Rafael Leao forced a good save from Vanja Milinkovic-Savic in the Torino goal. Soon after, Diogo Dalot should have scored when a rebound fell kindly to him, but his effort skewed onto the post. AC Milan substitute goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma was red-carded on the bench for dissent on a frustrating night as Brahim Diaz blasted over with the best chance of the second half. Tatarusanu then won the game with his shootout heroics.  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
