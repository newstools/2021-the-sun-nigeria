A 35-year-old man in Belarus set himself on fire outside the government headquarters in Minsk on Friday. The man was hospitalised after passers-by and the Police put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, the Police said. The man could be seen on fire on a sprawling, largely empty square in the centre of Minsk near a statue of Lenin in video footage shared online. Several people could be seen rushing towards him to try to put the flames out. The motives for the manâ€™s act were not immediately clear and investigators were working to establish the background, the Belarusian Investigative Committee said in a statement. It said the man had doused himself with a liquid before setting himself alight. Belarus has been rocked by rolling protests since a presidential election last summer, which the opposition says, was rigged in favour of the official winner and incumbent Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko denies the vote-rigging allegations. (Reuters/NAN)  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
