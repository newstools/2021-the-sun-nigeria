By Bolaji Okunola Super Eagles and Napoli FC goal poacher, Victor Osimhen, yesterday tasted action after 72 days of football absence due to COVID -19 and a shoulder injury The  Nigerian international, replaced Andrea Petagna in the 65th minutes of the game but failed to make an impact in the duel which ended 3-1 in favour of the host, Verona. Osimhen who last netted for the Naples in November 8 victory against Bologna, was a shadow of himself during the cracker which compounded coach Gennaro Gattuso’s woes. In his absence, the Italian side has lost four duels including last Wednesday’s Supercoppa Italian final which ended 2-0 in favour of Cristiano Ronaldo’s Juventus team. The 22 year old striker will be aiming to reclaim his scoring form when his side hosts Spezia on Thursday for the Coppa Italian quarter- final. Osimhen has scored two goals since joining the Italian giants last transfer window while his return saw Napoli dropped from 3rd to 6th on the log.
