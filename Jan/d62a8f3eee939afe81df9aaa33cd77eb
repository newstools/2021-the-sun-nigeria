From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has denied campaign posters bearing his name, which were said to have flooded the streets of Abuja yesterday. Governor Wike, speaking through the State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, said he has not informed anyone of his interest to run for nation’s presidency. The governor said the campaign posters were the handiwork of those threatened by his rising political profile. He said: “The attention of Governor Nyesom Wike has been drawn to campaign posters bearing his name which flooded some major streets of Abuja today. “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor has not informed anyone that he is interested in the Presidency of this country. “This is certainly the handiwork of mischief makers, who are threatened by the Governor’s rising political profile. “We are amused that political detractors will stop at nothing to see how they can distract Governor Wike’s visionary leadership”. Governor Wike advised members of the public to discountenance the posters, stressing the antics of his political detractors would certainly fail. He stated: “For the umpteenth time, we wish to restate that Governor Wike is presently preoccupied with his mission to make Rivers State a better place and destination of choice. “All the puerile antics of political jobbers aimed at heating up the polity will surely fail. “Members of the public are, therefore, advised to discountenance the misinformation that is currently circulating in Abuja”.
