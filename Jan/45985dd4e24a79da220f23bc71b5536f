Rivers State Governor, Nyesom  Wike, has reaffirmed the closure of Creek road in Port Harcourt to vehicular and human traffic beginning from midnight (Monday) to January 9, 2021. Governor Wike has also barred boat operators from using the Bonny -Bille Jetty during the same period. He stated this during inspection of the multi-million naira ultra modern Bonny-Bille jetty  on yesterday. Governor Wike bemoaned the conversion of the dualised  Creek road to  market by traders and the filthiness of the Bonny-Bille jetty that is due for commissioning this Saturday. The governor while addressing residents of the Bonny-Bille waterfront, explained that the State government would from Monday midnight, close Creek road and temporarily  shutdown  the jetty for a thorough  sanitation of the area. Governor Wike sternly warned that any trader or boat operator who dares to conduct any form of business along Creek road and the jetty, would face the full wrath of the law. The governor further   ordered the removal of all vehicles parked at the jetty and its surrounding environs. He directed law enforcement agencies to ensure that the temporary closure of Creek road and the Bonny-Bille, is enforced.
