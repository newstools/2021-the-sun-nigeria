La Liga team, Real Betis are interested in signing former Nigeria international Odion Ighalo in the January transfer window, according to Spanish sports daily, Estadio Deportivo. But the Manchester United’s striker proposed move to Real Betis is complicated because the Andalusian outfit have lost revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic and can only sell before buying new players. It is for that reason that Real Betis’ Chilean boss Manuel Pellegrini has reiterated that he’s 99.9 percent sure there won’t be any new signings in the January transfer window. Having said that, the sporting director of Real Betis, Antonio Cordón has drawn up a list of transfer targets and one name that Pellegrini likes is Ighalo. It is believed that Ighalo’s agent, Atta Aneke still maintains close ties with Real Betis, having brokered the deal that took Nigeria international, Nosa Igiebor to the club in August 2012. The Shanghai Shenhua-owned striker has seen his game time limited at Manchester United this season following the arrival of Edinson Cavani, making a paltry two starts from a possible 30 in all competitions. Ighalo previously played in the Spanish top-flight for Granada, scoring 13 goals in 73 matches, before sealing a move to Watford in 2014. His contract with Manchester United runs out in a week’s time and he is tied to parent club Shanghai Shenhua until December 2021.
