Former Super Eagles star, Augustine Eguavoen, revealed nothing Enyimba could have done to secure the CAF Champions League Group Stage qualification, saying the team had injury problems. In an interview with Soccernet, Eguavoen said the odds were already against the Aba side following their heavy defeat in the first leg. The two-time African champions had lost the first leg against El-Merriekh in Omdurman 3-0 and needed to win by four goals to secure qualification. However, they could only manage a 2-1 victory over the Sudanese, resulting in their exit from the competition. But when asked what went wrong in an interview with Soccernet, the team’s former manager, Eguavoen said there’s nothing the Aba boys could’ve done differently. “Nothing went wrong, I mean, coming back from 3-0 deficit is usually difficult, the former Super Eagles manager told Soccernet. Enyimba didn’t play that bad. They (El-Merriekh) were able to defend their three-goal lead. Eguavoven also added that Enyimba were affected by injury problems ahead of the game.
