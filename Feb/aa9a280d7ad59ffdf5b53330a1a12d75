The Olupo was a great man, a lover of his people, and an inimitable king under whom his people and community blossomed. His disposition to peace, harmony and development explains the love and wide acceptance he enjoyed from far and wide as a monarch,” the Governor said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Rafiu Ajakaye. “On behalf of the people and government of Kwara State, the Governor commiserates with the Kwara State Council of Chiefs led by his Royal Highness the Emir of Ilorin, the Irepodun Traditional Council, the people of Ajase-Ipo, the immediate and extended royal families of the ancient town, and friends and associates of the Olupo on this sad development. He prays the Almighty Allaah to repose the soul of the monarch, and grant the community the fortitude to bear the loss.” Similarly, former Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed has commiserated with Ajasse Ipo’s people over the death of His Royal Highness Oba Sikiru Atanda Woleola, the Olupo of Ajase Ipo and Chairman, Igbomina-Ekiti Traditional Council, who passed on Sunday.
