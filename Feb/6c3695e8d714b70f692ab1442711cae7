It was 6-0 in the 38th minute, when former BIIK Kazygurt and Bayelsa Queens winger Adule headed home Ogbonna’s beautiful cross.
After setting up goals and winning a penalty, Payne finally got her name on the scoresheet as she fired past goalkeeper Emiliana Nchama Ndong from distance to increase the tally and give the Falcons a big lead going into the break.
FC Robo Queens’ Monday Gift and Oshoala scored both goals for Falcons to complete the rout in the second half of match.
