By Omodele Adigun As COVID-19 triggered exponential increase in electronic-payment adoption, five Nigerian banks have incurred N80.75 billion expenses in fees and commission just as the value of digital  transactions rose to N111.29trillion in nine months.
The five lenders, UBA, Zenith, Access Bank, FBN Holdings and GT Bank have their earnings gutted by a whopping N80.75 billion in e-payment channel fees and commissions during the nine months period of 2020, which coincided with the COVID -19 lockdown. The figure, however,  represents 29.8 per cent increase over the N62.19 billion fees and commission expenses in the prior nine-month period, investigation has shown.
The banks also made N127.3 billion income as more customers turned to electronic banking options in order to escape COVID-19 infections.
Fees and commission expenses are charged for the provision of services rendered on internet banking, mobile banking and online purchasing platforms.
These  expenses include costs incurred by banks for providing alternative platforms for purposes of internet banking, mobile banking and online channels.
Experts, however, blamed the high fees and commission expenses incurred by the banks on the upsurge in customers’ online transactions as the only option during the COVID -19 restriction.
Also during the period Ecobank said it recordedfive per cent increase in its transactions done through digital channels while only five per cent was physical where branches were still open.
Its Group CEO Ade Ayeyemi,  who had earlier predicted the increase said “Cashless society is accelerating in Africa through the pandemic. COVID-19 is the greatest accelerator of our time. We are going to have more and more of digital transactions.
In one of the countries, banks were closed within 48 hours. People quickly switched over to ATM channels. Before COVID- 19, 90 per cent of our transactions were digital, while the remaining 10 per cent was physical. But during COVID 19 (lockdown), we saw 95 pr cent of transactions done through digital means, while only five per cent was physical where branches were still open.
“As governments are using digital platform to give palliatives to the people, more customers are becoming accustomed to the digital platforms. It is cheaper, safe and delivered at affordable prices. Cash is bulky, it is more difficult to deliver to the people. COVID 19 is the greatest accelerator of adoption. People have tasted it and they liked it.”
