We are saying that any exercise that doesn’t happen through us is null and void, it’s illegal, the exercise should happen through the validly elected executives. ‘So, we would approach a high court to get an injunction against the exercise, that is if not being done through the legal people, not that we are against the exercise, we are on the process of getting the injunction, waiting for hearing notice. ‘For now, we are on standby, the exercise continues till March 30, so there’s no rush.
