Who are we to question God? ‘As we continue with necessary arrangements to repatriate his remains and accord him a hero’s farewell that he eminently deserves, we shall endeavour to carry everybody along.’ Ossy was said to have been first flown to London last year for the treatment of an undisclosed ailment, but when the matter got worst, he was transferred to Germany where he finally died.
