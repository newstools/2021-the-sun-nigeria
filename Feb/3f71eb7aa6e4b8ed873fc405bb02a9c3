Portfolio investments are passive investments, as they do not entail active management or control of the issuing company.
The foreign investors have a relatively short-term interest in the ownership of the investments because the aim is solely financial gain, in contrast to Foreign Direct Investment which allows an investor to have managerial control over a company.
