From Desmond Mgboh, Kano Kano State Agro Pastoral Development Project, KSADP, will conduct a livestock census with a view to obtaining a reliable data on livestock numbers, products and production system in the state. “The livestock survey is very important because it will provide the much needed data for the formulation and implementation of the livestock productivity enhancement component of our project”. The State Project Coordinator, Ibrahim Garba Muhammad announced this while receiving the National Project Coordinator, Livestock Productivity and Resilience Support Project (L-PRES) Winnie Lai-Solarin, in his office. In this regard, Ibrahim explained that the project would seek the support of the Dakar-based financial and management consulting firm, Africa Consulting and Trading (ACT Afrique Group), to conduct a thorough job. “Livestock plays a very important role in agriculture in this part of the country but, unfortunately, the data we have on livestock is obsolete and unreliable. Therefore, we need accurate information and statistics to guide us on the design and implementation of our livestock productivity and enhancement initiatives”, he stressed. Earlier, the National Project Coordinator, Livestock Productivity and Resilience Support Project (L-PRES), Winnie Lai-Solarin, said she was in Kano to discuss with the KSADP Project Management Unit, on how her office and the KSADP can collaborate in the areas of pasture development, artificial insemination, milk collection and training of pastoralists. She suggested the creation of an innovation platform to facilitate synergy between projects concerned with livestock development, pointing out that doing so would ensure project sustainability and avoidance of duplicity as well as wastage .
