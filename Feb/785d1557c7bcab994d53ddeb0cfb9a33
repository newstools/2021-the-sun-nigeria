From Rose Ejembi, Makurdi The Benue State Government is to commence the implementation of the interim agreement on the payment of N30,000 minimum wage to civil servants on grade levels one to six. Governor Samuel Ortom disclosed this on Tuesday when he met with the labour union leaders in the state. The governor, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said he had already directed the state Head of Service to immediately implement the payment of the minimum wage to workers in line with the agreement his administration earlier reached with labour leaders. He thanked the labour leaders for their understanding and reaffirmed his commitment to implementation of the agreement. ‘He assured Benue workers that the present administration will continue to give priority to their welfare while addressing other challenges of development,’ the statement ended.
