It is clearly stated in the civil service rules that no officer is allowed to be partisan. “We are aware that the APC suffers a major setback as people of Kano are dissuaded not to participate in the ongoing membership registration and validation exercise because the party has failed to fulfil its promises both at federal and state levels” he stated.
