RB Leipzig manager, Julian Nagelsmann has confessed that the Bundesliga’s high-flyers were interested in signing Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen following his spectacular season at Lille.
But the respected tactician admitted that Leipzig could not afford the 22-year-old whose exploits in France meant he would cost more than €50 million.
Osimhen followed a 20-goal season in Belgium at Sporting Charleroi with an incredible 18 goals in all competitions in his maiden campaign at Lille, raising his profile beyond the roof.
Nearly every major club across the top leagues in Europe had the Nigerian forward on their shopping list after that feat.
But Osimhen eventually agreed to move to Italy, joining Napoli for a fee that made him the most expensive African player transfer in history.
Leipzig later signed Norway international, Alexander Sörloth after missing out on their number one target Osimhen, who was way beyond the German side’s budget.
“Victor Osimhen was once in conversation, then he moved from Lille to Naples for over €60 million,” Nagelsmann said to Kicker via Fussballtransfers.
“There is a financial policy that we have and all strikers who guarantee a lot of goals cost upwards of €50 million. You have to be honest, that was just too much for us.”
Osimhen has managed only two Serie A goals for Gennaro Gattuso’s side but the former Wolfsburg star shone brightly as Napoli shocked champions Juventus at the Diego Maradona Stadium over the weekend. Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
