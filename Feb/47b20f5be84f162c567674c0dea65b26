By Gabriel Dike Two non-academic staff of the Lagos State University (LASU), Ojo, have been sacked for misconduct by the highest decision making organ of the university. Also, two workers escaped the sack hammer, but were issued warning letters while a lecturer was ordered to refund over N9 million or get sacked.
Saturday Sun learnt that one of the sacked staff in the Registry was involved in admission racketeering. The other dismissed staff in the Exams and Record was involved in forgery of transcript.
A senior staff in the Registry Unit told Saturday Sun that the workers affected appeared before the staff disciplinary committee, which forwarded its recommendations to the Governing Council for approval. The Governing Council of LASU under the chairmanship of Prof. Adebayo Ninalowo approved the dismissal, issuance of warning to two staff and the order to refund over N9 million by the academic staff.

The senior registry staff told Saturday Sun that when the transcript was sent to the Postgraduate office for verification, it was discovered he had procured a fake document.
