Former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has commiserated with a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State and eminent businessman, Daniel Okeke, over the death of his father-in-law, Stephen Ipia Okeke, who died on Wednesday.
Describing the demise of the late retired civil servant as a big loss to Ubila Ututu community, Kalu urged the Okeke family to uphold the remarkable legacies of their late patriarch.
The former governor said the deceased was a seasoned public servant, compassionate community leader and philanthropist, who instilled good moral values in his children and in-laws.
Kalu, in a condolence message to the family, urged them to take solace in the good name their late patriarch left behind.
He said: “On behalf of the people of Abia North senatorial district, I convey my sincere and heartfelt condolences to Chief Daniel and Chief (Mrs) Agnes Okeke, over the demise of Mr. Stephen Ipia Okeke, a community leader in Ubila Ututu, Arochukwu council of Abia State.
“The demise of the respected and seasoned public servant is a huge loss to his community and beyond.
“However, I urge the Okeke family to sustain the worthy attributes of their late patriarch.
“No doubt, he will be greatly missed by family, friends, loved ones and associates.”
