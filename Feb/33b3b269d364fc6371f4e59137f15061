From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja Federal Government yesterday, announced the opening of the Third Mainland Bridge closed since July 24, last year.
The bridge was partially closed for rehabilitation and maintenance for over six months.

In a statement, the minister expressed his deep appreciation to all those who played one positive role or another including the contractor, Messrs Borini Prono, Federal Road Management Agency (FERMA), Lagos State Management Agency (LASTMA), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the media and civil society organisations too numerous to mention individually.
