Ihejirika who gave the advice during an economic empowerment event organised by the Amaba Daughters Association, in Isuikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State, said with the challenges of COVID-19, farmers should be encouraged in all its ramifications to produce enough food to feed the populace.
“All barriers and challenges to farming should be removed to enable farmers feel free to farm and produce food for the society this year,” Ihejirika said
