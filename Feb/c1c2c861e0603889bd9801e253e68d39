Ezeilo, who stated that Ugwuanyi’s administration captured the rehabilitation of the 9th Mile Crash Programme Water Supply Scheme with solar powered boreholes in the 2021 budget, disclosed the state government recently awarded a N600 million contract for the project aimed at boosting potable water supply from Oji River, Ajali and Iva Valley water schemes to Enugu metropolis and environs, when completed.
Revealing that the state government targets production of 40,000 cubic meters of water, the deputy governor highlighted other efforts of the present administration to also include the commencement of AFD-funded 3rd National Urban Water Sector Reform Project, the integration of Adada Water Scheme and rehabilitation of other water schemes as well as reticulation, drilling of new boreholes with storage facilities across the state.
Ezeilo said the government has commenced processes for the new Okwojo Ngwo boreholes augmentation in Udi Local Government Area to Enugu metropolis, a network of ten solar powered boreholes and a newly conceived design that would help boost water production and distribution to Enugu metropolis and environs.
Responding on behalf of other members of the board, Diyoke assured the governor they will do their best to meet the requirements and expectations of the people with respect to water supply.  Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
