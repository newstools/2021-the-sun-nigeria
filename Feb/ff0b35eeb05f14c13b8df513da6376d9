An Abuja mobile court, yesterday, shutdown popular Wuse market, the UTC and the Murg shopping plazas for violating the presidential regulations on COVID-19.
The court also convicted about 100 persons who were arrested by the enforcement team for not wearing face masks in public places.

The court presided over by Magistrate Idayat Akanni, fined the violators N2,000 each, with an option of two weeks community service.
