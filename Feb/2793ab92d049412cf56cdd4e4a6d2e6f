Callum Hudson-Odoi insists he’s happy to stay patient at Chelsea.
The 20-year-old has featured sporadically for the Blues, who spent over £200m on transfers this summer.
“You train hard at Chelsea every day, the managers are always looking and you always want to prove a point that you are ready when called upon,” Hudson-Odoi told reporters.
“When I train and play in games, I want to score, assist, work hard for the team and always improve myself on the pitch and to prove a point as well.
“No matter what it is, I want to give 100 per cent, keep trying and staying positive. I have the right people behind me, giving me the right instructions and keeping me grounded. I am really happy with the people in the background with that and I want to get back into the team.”
