 Award winning Model, Olayinka Beyonce Omotoyinbo has told our Correspondent in Lagos, how she got an endorsement deal for the first time. Olayinka disclosed this in an interview in her parents home, shortly after she was awarded for the second time in modelling. According to her parents, when we sort audience with them, the mother, Mrs. Omotoyinbo poured encomiums on her daughter, and said, Olayinka is a kind, bubbly kid that has great liking for fashion and video content creation. She is witty, and always willing to create; although young, her passion, patience and resilience in creating content is admirable. She is a complete natural, she said.  According to her Father, Baby Yink’s first endorsement deal didn’t come as a surprise to them, as they had seen a spike in her engagement on social media, with frequent comments as to how well she would do as a brand influencer. A renowned skin care company in Nigeria reached out to have Olayinka model and influence for their kiddy’s kit; a role she took on like a natural, they were completely blown away by her show of confidence, comprehension and willingness to learn at their first engagement with baby yinks. Since then, it has been from one endorsement to another. She is a blessed child, and we are proud to have her. We have never relented in encouraging her to pursue her dreams. That is what we owe her, and we believe that, other kids can learn from her calm disposition in handling things, and in their way of life, he said.
