Trust is most needed quality in any business,  consistent commitment to the total well being of customers, total satisfaction of clients and consultants are imperative for the growth of business. This among others was canvassed by the Managing Director of ATCOHOMES, Mr. Triumph-Abatan Oluwayomi while speaking to newsmen in Lagos. According to Oluwayomi who is also the president/founder of Arrow Leadership development foundation ALDEF, “aside selling land, we are interested in the happiness and fulfilment of our clients when buying from us. I often tell the staff that we are not in business because of the profit mainly but rather to service everyone God will direct our path to buy from us. Our goal is service and not gains. That is the reason we energetically drive ‘Reality to a wealthier life!’ mandate of ATCOHOMES. “We are unique in the way and manner we go about our business. We believe business is not a do or die thing but a do and live matter, hence profit and gains do not drive us, our consultant commission structure is best to none in this industry especially with those with same years with us, we build houses that our customers are glad to live in because we build as if we are living in them ourselves. We help our clients with flexible payment plans, for instance a payment plan for 24 months with 0 per cent interest on the cost of land,” Oluwayomi said. “Government is trying their best but as usual we always want more of everything, but government cannot give everything.
