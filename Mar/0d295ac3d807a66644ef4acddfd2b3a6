From Sola Ojo, Kaduna The Action Alliance (AA) political party on Monday disowned Kenneth Obidike Udeze as its National Chairman. This was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of an emergency Virtual National Executive Council meeting. The communique signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Olu Omotoso, stated that Udeze ceased to be a member of the Action Alliance since February 14, 2020. The communique added that Udeze was found wanting on several allegations bordering on criminal diversions of party funds, unilateral alteration of party papers and documents, forgery and anti-party activities. According to the document, ‘a disciplinary committee was set up to look into these allegations, he was invited to defend himself, and he blatantly refused to do so. ‘Upon the third invitation by our party constitution, the committee drew up and submitted its report. ‘NTTC, the highest ruling caucus of our party sat and review the recommendations of the committee. The caucus gave him another lifeline to come and defend himself, he also refused to do so till the lifeline lapsed. ‘Thereafter, the caucus suspended him at its scheduled meeting monitored by INEC as required by law,’ the communique read in part. The communique further explained that follow-up to his suspension and his refusal to come up with a defence against all allegations levelled against him, the National Convention of the party resolved and expelled him on February 14, 2020. ‘This Convention was adequately monitored by INEC, he was formally informed, and it was also widely publicised. ‘He has since gone to five (5) different Courts to ask for reinstatement as chairman, and all five Courts have ruled against him. ‘He has employed many strategies to arm-twist the courts to procure a judgment in his usual way, but has not succeeded, hence his new approach to deceive the people by using the media to strangulate facts,’ the communique added.
