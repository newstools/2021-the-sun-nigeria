From Paul Osuyi, Asaba Journalists were on Tuesday prevented from covering the proceedings in the trial of four accused persons in the kidnap and murder of the late Obi of Ubulu-Uku in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State, Obi Akaeze Ofolue III. Ofolue III was kidnapped in early January, 2016 while on his way to Asaba by heavily armed men who led him into the bush. Efforts to rescue him unhurt were futile as his decomposing was found two weeks later leaning on a tree. Subsequently, four suspects who were arrested, have been facing trial in open court.
