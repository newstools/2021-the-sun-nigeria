From Tony Osauzo, Benin It was tales of agony and woes  for several commuters on the Benin-Ore expressway, yesterday, following a blockade at Ofosu by angry petroleum tanker and other articulated vehicle drivers over the killing of two of their members  by suspected Fulani herdsmen Tuesday night. Ofosu is boundary community between Edo and Ondo states. The killer herdsmen were said to have also made away with an undisclosed amount of money from the drivers. In protest, the drivers reportedly blocked the highway at a military checkpoint and refused all entreaties made to them by other motorists to vacate the road. The chaotic atmosphere caused by the blockade was said to have forced operatives at the military checkpoint to abandoned their post. At at press time, it was learnt that the protesting  drivers were insisting that Edo Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, must  address them before they open up the road for use.
