When the matter with suit number FHC/AB/FHR/25/21 came up for mentioning before Justice Muhammad Shittu Abubakar, yesterd, counsel to the applicants  Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN),  told the court that he had been unable to serve some of the parties involved in the matter. Ayorinde added that he had served the court process on only six (06) out the 16 respondents based on the verifiable addresses, while the 10 others would be served through a substituted service, praying the court to accept the method as being dully served. Joined in the suit are fifteen members of the Osugbo society of Ijebuland and the Ijebu Traditional Council as the 16th respondent. Ayorinde emphasized that the need to tender the prayer became exigent so that the respondents, through their counsel would not feign ignorance of being dully served in the near future. Responding, the defense counsel, Sola Opeodu, did not object and the court granted the prayer.
