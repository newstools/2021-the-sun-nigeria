By Lukman Olabiyi Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams has stated that a new security outfit that will compliment effort of the Western Nigeria Security Network, Operation Amotekun, and other security agencies in tackling the insecurity ravaging the region would soon be unveiled. Speaking at a press conference in Lagos, he said the new security outfit would involve all security groups, traditional rulers and other stakeholders in the region. He said stakeholders involved would deliberate on the issue in Ibadan Oyo State on March 17. Adams and some members ofÂ  the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere present at the press briefing also called on the six governors of the region to inject at least 15 per cent of their annual budget into agriculture. Iba Adams, Afenifere spokesman, Yinka Odumakin and a chieftain of the group, Sola Lawal said investing a huge amount of money on agriculture will play a huge impact in providing sustainable food production for the region. They condemned the recent protest by food sellers in the northern part of the country, which prevented food from the area from coming to the Southwest. The trio said investment in agriculture would provide employment, enhance internally generated revenue, provide food security, reduce urban congestion and enlarge the coast for participatory modernised agriculture. Adams explained that the Southwest spent a huge amount on food daily, adding that the protest was a clarion call to the Southwest leaders to provide the necessary security for farmers in order to produce enough agricultural produce.
