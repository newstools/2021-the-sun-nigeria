Before of the plea of judge was taken, counsel to the EFCC, Suleiman Suleiman, applied to the court to withdraw the name of Obla from the charge. The court granted the request and Obla was accordingly acquitted and discharged. This paved the way for the re-arraignment of  Ajumogobia as the sole defendant in the amended charge. In the first count, the EFCC claimed that: “Ajumogobia on or about the 11th day of July, 2014 ,in Lagos , indirectly concealed the total sum of N12m in the Diamond Bank  account of Nigel & Colive Ltd., a sum she reasonably ought to have known forms part of proceeds of an unlawful act…and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 15(3) of the same act.
