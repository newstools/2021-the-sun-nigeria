At the ceremony, which took place at the Tafawa Balewa House, Abuja, were the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and the Deputy Governor of Kano State, Alhaji Nasiru Yusuf-Gawuna.

Addressing the ambassadors-designate, Onyeama said the presentation represented many years of very hard work on their part, adding that the presentation was also a fulfillment of their labour.
