From Tony Osauzo, Benin Edo State Governor Mr Godwin Obaseki has said he holds no personal grudges against his predecessor and former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole, but only dislikes his style of politics. He stated this while speaking to reporters at the weekend in Auchi, Etsako West Local Government Area of the state on the occasion of the Centenary Birthday Thanksgiving of Msgr Thomas Oleghe and 18th Canonical Erection Anniversary of the Diocese of Auchi held at Immaculate Conception Cathedral in Auchi. Obaseki, who exchanged greetings with an elbow-bump in compliance with COVID-19 preventive protocols, with his predecessor, said they are both sons of Edo with interest of the state at heart. ‘I don’t have anything personal against Oshiomhole. I may not like his politics, but he has not done anything personal against me. We all are interacting with the interest of the country and the development of our community at heart,’ the governor said. The governor announced that the Zonal Congress of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), which was scheduled to hold on Saturday, was postponed due to the local government elections which held in Delta State. ‘The Zonal Congress, which was to hold today, has been postponed to Tuesday and it’s a normal routine to satisfy the party’s constitution; there is nothing amiss,’ he explained. On his part, Oshiomhole, who was a guest at the event, hailed his successor, Governor Obaseki, describing him as “”his brother and friend”. ‘Once the governor speaks, the matter ends. The governor knows that pensioners here might not be able to do much, that is why he said every other thing required to complete the hostel of the Catholic School of Nursing and Midwifery in Uzairue, his government will do,’ Oshiomhole said.
