As the Glo-sponsored CNN African Voices Changemakers goes on air this weekend, the issue of wildlife and the importance of preserving them will be discussed by two conservation enthusiasts. Kenya’s Sheila Funnell and South Africa’s Marumo Nene are the two guests on the programme who will be talking about the need for the protection and preservation of the African continent’s animal life. Funnell is a research manager at the Grevy’s Zebra Trust who dedicates her time to the protection of zebras as she believes that the conservation of the animals will help sustain the livelihoods of the people. Grevy’s zebras are important in the Samburu culture where she hails from as they lead the way to water during droughts, alert herders and livestock to the presence of predators. They also believe that their presence signifies the coming of the rains. Similarly, Nene works with South Africa’s Wildlife ACT team and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife as part of an Alien Plant Removal project in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve.  She completed her Community Guide Training, worked as an assistant on the African Wild Dog monitoring project, and as a Community Environmental Educator. African Voices Changemakers will be on air on Saturday at 9.30 a.m. and 5.30 p.m. on DSTV Channel 401 and on Sunday at 3.30 a.m., 6.30 a.m., 11.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. The last repeat edition is at 4.30 a.m. on Monday.
