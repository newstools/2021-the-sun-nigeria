From Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja A group comprising of PDP Anambra State House of Assembly candidates in the 2019 elections have called on the state government to, as a matter of urgency, conduct democratic local government elections or risk a lawsuit. This was made known in a pre-action letter signed by a lawyer to the group, CJ Okoli Akirika. The letter dated 13th February 2021 also noted that failure to conduct the election will lead to the group seeking redress in court, saying that it hopes the governor does the needful by conducting the said elections.
