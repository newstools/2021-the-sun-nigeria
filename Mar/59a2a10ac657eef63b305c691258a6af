By Cosmas Omegoh, Lagos The Kogi State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Hon Kingsley Fanwo has dismissed what he called ‘attention-seeking insinuation’ by one Mr Deji Adeyanju on Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, describing his statements as ‘lazy gossip’. Fanwo spoke on the allegation by Adeyanju, an activist, that Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello told people that Chief Fani-Kayode was begging for an appointment with President Muhammadu Buhari. ‘Adeyanju has no justification for such a reckless rumour because such statements never came from the governor,’ the Kogi commissioner said. ‘The governor and Chief Fani-Kayode have decided to work together in addressing some of the challenges facing the nation, especially in the areas of security and nation-building. ‘Deji Adeyanju over the years have been known for such careless, reckless, unsubstantiated, and unimaginable falsehood,’ he said. He encouraged well-meaning Nigerians to bury their political differences and work with Governor Bello to realise a peaceful and prosperous country.
