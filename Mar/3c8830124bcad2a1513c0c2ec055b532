The U17 Peace Cup sponsored by the Effiong Akwa led Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board, is gathering more momentum, with stakeholders increasingly throwing their weight behind the competition. Joining the list is Medical committee member of the Confederation of African Football, CAF, Dr. Peter Singabele (MNI), and former Super Eagles striker, Aaron Samuel. According to Dr. Singabele who spoke on Thursday during an interview with a member of the Media and Publicity committee of the competition, Patrick Ndubuisi, in Yenagoa, said the U17 and other under age group tourney remains the best avenue to select and groom budding talents for the future. “The competition is a beautiful development, and with NDDC getting involve that means the Niger Delta states, will certainly have an opportunity to showcase their talents mainly from the rural areas”. “My charge to the organisers is let’s get the rules straight, because in competitions of this nature the usual problem is that people want to cheat. Let’s get expert who are quite conversant with organising youths tournaments, like here in Bayelsa you don’t forget people like Coach Ada Gwegwe, let them be involved so that they can quickly screen and get the right materials in”.
