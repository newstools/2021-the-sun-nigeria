President General of Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo (NNII) and former minister of women affairs and social development, Iyom Josephine Anenih, has called on women from all walks of life and diverse cultures to stand up and be counted in the development agenda of the nation.
She spoke in Abuja at the public presentation of the book, “Made In Aba” an autobiography written by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe which reflects the cultural heritage and strides of the Igbo nation.
Iyom Anenih who described the work put together by Senator Abaribe as a pride of Ndi Igbo heritage said Aba remained significant for many obvious reasons which include industrialisation and the Aba Women’s war of 1929. She said Aba, as encapsulated in the book, evokes strong patriotic emotions and stands in history as the beacon of female activism and leadership hence, it beckons on Women particularly from Igbo extraction to rise up and work in partnership with their male counterparts to foster peace, unity and development of Igbo land.
Anenih added that women were determined to bring quality to governance which necessitates raising a new generation of women to add value to the nation and her economy.
